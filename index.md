On Tue 30th July 2024, we had a great day at Code by the Coast, at The Heights, Portland, Dorset. OSGeo:UK's latest code sprint brought 18 people together to work on a number of FOSS4G projects, including Terra Draw and GIFramework Maps. Along with the great coding and networking, we also had some lovey views in an excellent venue. 

Many thanks to both OSGeo:UK GoFundGeo and Addresscloud for sponsoring the event, and for those participants who paid for their own tickets - we couldn't have done it without you!

### FOSS4G:UK Local 2023

[FOSS4G:UK Local 2023](foss4guklocal2023/index.html) went really well. It was held on Thurs 7th Sept, and we reached about 250 people across eight venues in two countries. We raised about £5000 for OSGeo:UK which will go towards our funding of Open Source Geospatial software over the coming year. The full programme is available in [PDF](foss4guklocal2023/2023_MAIN_Agenda - Google Sheets.pdf){:target="_newpage"} or [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ewkqvMZqXIwDtyEtCxdKte7czpZxUjqqlCZkY1REmzc/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_newpage"}. See individual [venue pages](foss4guklocal2023/index.html#venues) pages for more details. 

We have done a short [write up](foss4guklocal2023/lessons-learned.html), summarising some of the feedback and highlighting a few of the lessons learned for next time. We’re planning to run a conference in 2024, and will be asking for volunteers early next year - so please sign up to the [mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/uk) or email <span class="osgeoemail"></span> to find out when we’ll be meeting to discuss this.
