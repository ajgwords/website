<h2 style="margin-top:0;">Talks & Workshops</h2>

Our call for talks and workshops ended on 30th April and we've had lots of amazing submissions on both fronts, so we're looking forward to a fantastic few days! It'll be a friendly, relaxed conference where we discuss all things free, open source and geo-related.

* Take a look at our **[2019 Programme](FOSS4GUK_2019_Programme.pdf "FOSS4GUK 2019 Programme"){:target="_blank"}** - packed full of interesting talks & workshops!
* All the **[Talk Abstracts](FOSS4GUK_2019_Abstracts.pdf "FOSS4GUK 2019 Talk Abstracts"){:target="_blank"}** are available too.

Tickets are **&#163;80 for the two day conference**, including lunch and refreshments and will be released in July 2019.

<h3 style="margin-top:40px;">Unconference</h3>
If you've missed the talks deadline but still have something you'd like to say, there will also be an opportunity to contribute during an 'unconference' session - this is likely to be an informal session of lightning-style talks (more details closer to the event).
