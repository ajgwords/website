<h2 style="margin-top:0;">Widening Participation</h2>

We are aiming to make FOSS4G UK 2019 as welcoming, inclusive and accessible as possible, and we are very grateful to SkyScanner for the generous financial support to enable this.

### Children

We are offering grants of up to &pound;100 to help cover **childcare costs at home** that you are incurring specifically to enable you to attend the conference. We will reimburse these costs after the conference, and will require proof of payment - i.e. a receipt or letter from the childcare provider. Please get in touch if you would like more information about this.

Children & babies will also be welcome at the conference itself.
<br>

### Hearing Support

If you let us know during registration that you require a sign language interpreter, then we will make arrangements to have this available (there is an induction loop in the main auditorium).
<br>

### Vision Support

Please let us know if you have any visual requirements we can assist with - e.g. seating and lighting, and we will do our best to accommodate these.
<br>

### Accessibility

Dynamic Earth's **[accessibility statement](https://www.dynamicearth.co.uk/media/1714/access-statement.pdf "Dynamic Earth - Accessibility Statement"){:target="_blank"}** provides in depth information about access to and within the building, as well as other useful information about the venue. The 'Corporate Events' section (p16) covers the rooms that the conference will be held in.

### Inclusivity
We would like to encourage everyone to add pronouns to their name badges - we will provide a space for this. The more people who do this, the more welcome and included everyone will feel.

During the social parts of the conference, why not try ways to make things **[less intimidating](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/ "Pac-man appraoch to conferences"){:target="_blank"}** and easier for others to join in the conversation. And there's always **[more for us to think about...](https://github.com/mxsasha/lessobviouschecklist "The Less Obvious Conference Checklist"){:target="_blank"}**
<br>
<hr/>

### Anything else?
If there's anything else we can do to help provide a more enjoyable experience for you, then please get in touch and we'll see what we can do!
