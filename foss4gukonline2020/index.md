FOSS4GUK Online 2020 was a big success - for an outlay of around £200, we had:

* 600 delegates from 77 countries
* 33 presentations
* £2,500 raised for OSGeo and MapAction
* 270 subscribers to our YouTube channel

----

[OSGeo:UK](https://uk.osgeo.org/) are running a one day online FOSS4G event on 17th June 2020. This will give us all a little FOSS4G fix in this strange time, and make a small contribution to the big holes left by the cancellation of IRL FOSS4G events. We'll share some of the work we’ve been doing since the world changed, and maybe pave the way for more online events in future.

## Programme
The schedule for the day is [here](programme.html), and the full session listing of abstracts is [here](sessions.html). This is still subject to change, so keep an eye out for updates.

There are three parallel streams of roughly 30 minutes sessions covering seven themes. All sessions will be recorded so you can catch up later if there are clashes between your favourite topics.

## Tickets/Registration
Registration is open now, and closes at 24:00 on 16th June (unless we are sold out before then). It's fine just to come to one or two sessions, but you will still need to register _before the day_ - this allows us to manage numbers.

Register [on Eventbrite here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/foss4guk-2020-online-registration-105523419388){:target="_newpage"}.

## Cost
The event is free to attend but we *strongly* encourage attendees (and/or their employers) to make a donation of £20 (more if you can afford or less if you can't) to one of these causes:

* [OSGeo:UK](https://paypal.me/osgeouk)
* [MapAction](https://mapaction.org/donate/)
* A charity of your choice

## Helping out
We (the [OSGeo:UK committee](#who)) would appreciate any help you can provide, either before, during, or after the event - please sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6pVdrMBN4BYw6pEfjPXD8z_oRMZWxQ-tvsh2mrwTcn8aP8Q/viewform) if you are able to chip in - for example we will need hosts/co-hosts for sessions.
