### FOSS4G is coming to Bristol again!

OSGeo:UK is pleased to announce that there will be a regional one day FOSS4G event in Bristol this year on _12th November_,  at the [Engine Shed at Bristol Temple Meads](https://engine-shed.co.uk/), following on from our events there in 2023 and 2022. This will be an in person only event, but we hope to be able to record and publish presentations if we can.

The [programme](https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2024/bristol.html#programme) is now confirmed - we've got a packed day with 14 fantastic talks, so sign up now to confirm your place!

### Registration

_This event is now sold out!_ As in previous years, there is a registration fee of £20 (including refreshments and lunch) to cover costs - any surplus made from tickets and sponsorship will be used to allow OSGeo:UK to provide financial support to open source geospatial projects (see [Past Donations](https://uk.osgeo.org/pastdonations.html) to see how we have supported open source geospatial projects).

We also want FOSS4G:UK South West 2024 to be as accessible as possible, so we have a number of codes available for free tickets. These are available for students, under represented groups, those on a low income, those in precarious employment, and anyone else for whom a £20 ticket would be a barrier (financial or administrative). All of these criteria are self-defined. We very much encourage you to email <osgeouk@gmail.com> to ask for a code, stating which group you belong to (no further justification is needed).
