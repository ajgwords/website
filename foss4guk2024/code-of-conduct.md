# Code of Conduct for FOSS4G:UK South West 2024

## General Guidelines

FOSS4G:UK South West 2024 is an person conference.

These guidelines are meant as a tool to help presenters and attendees have an enjoyable event, and should be read alongside the general [OSGeo Code of Conduct](https://www.osgeo.org/code_of_conduct/), which applies to all platforms and communication mediums.

Participants at FOSS4G:UK South West 2024 are expected to act respectfully toward others in accordance with the [https://berlincodeofconduct.org/](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/).

## Diversity Statement

OSGeo welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are committed to being a community that everyone feels good about joining, and we will always work to treat everyone well. No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.


## Escalating and/Reporting a Problem

Issues that cannot be handled by the presentation chairs or conference chairs should be escalated to the OSGeo:UK conference committee by e-mail <span class="osgeoemail"></span>.


## Meeting recordings

Most presentations will be recorded and uploaded to the FOSS4G:UK YouTube channel for public viewing. This is done on an opt-in basis, when you submit to the call for talks. If you wish to change your mind, then you must explicitly contact the OSGeo:UK conference committee by e-mail <span class="osgeoemail"></span>.

Presentations where a code of conduct violation is known to have occurred will be treated separately and a joint decision between the presenter, chair, and the conference organising committee will be made as to whether the recording should be made available.

## Be Nice

We have run many in person conferences before, we hope we have thought of everything and that the day runs smoothly. But if stuff goes wrong, please be patient, we will get problems fixed as fast as we can and will provide updates.
