### Accommodation

We've created a predefined search on Google Maps that might [help you narrow down your choice](https://encrypted.google.com/search?safe=strict&hl=en&rlla=0&hotel_dates=2018-03-07%2C2018-03-10&sz=14&hotel_ds=1&tbm=lcl&ei=xwUsWomTOcT_ULarj8AE&hotel_occupancy=2&q=hotels&oq=hotels&gs_l=psy-ab.3...109705.110150.0.110267.6.4.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..6.0.0....0.RhrW4b011bg#rlfi=hd:2018-03-07,2018-03-10;si:;mv:!1m3!1d40195.88868441375!2d-0.07171367998103051!3d51.510579556401375!3m2!1i1500!2i777!4f13.1;tbs:lf_hd:-1,lf_ho:2,lrf:!1m4!1u13!2m2!13m1!1b1!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e6!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e4!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e5!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e10!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e2!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e1!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e3!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e7!2m1!1e4!2m1!1e13!2m25!1e10!4m2!11m1!1e6!4m2!11m1!1e4!4m2!11m1!1e5!4m2!11m1!1e10!4m2!11m1!1e2!4m2!11m1!1e1!4m2!11m1!1e3!4m2!11m1!1e7!2m7!1e17!4m2!17m1!1e3!4m2!17m1!1e8!2m26!1e7!4m4!7m3!1m1!1u150!3sGBP!4m4!7m3!1m1!1u200!3sGBP!4m4!7m3!1m1!1u250!3sGBP!4m4!7m3!1m1!1u400!3sGBP!5m4!7m3!1m1!1u153!3sGBP!2m4!1e2!5m2!2m1!2e8!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:6).

Here are some hotels the committee has stayed in previously and can recommend:

* [Qbic](https://qbichotels.com/london-city/) (Aldgate) - cheap, modern, clean and affordable. Located in Aldgate it's a short tube to Farringdon, and walkable for the brave.
* [Town Hall](https://www.townhallhotel.com/) (Bethnal Green) - set in Bethnal Greens old town hall, great hotel for more lenient budgets.


### Code Sprint

The Code sprint will be 9-5 at [Geolytix](https://www.google.com/maps/place/GEOLYTIX/@51.5274234,-0.116575,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x48761b47b00578b3:0xd6a50e79900bcae!8m2!3d51.5273967!4d-0.1152554?hl=en). Lunch will be provided thanks to the generosity of our sponsors.
