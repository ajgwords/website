## [FOSS4G UK 2018](/foss4guk2018/) : FOSS4G UK Code Sprint

### 09:00-17:00 10 March 2018 - registration required

The codesprint is *not* about learning how to use software. It is about developing software. This includes:

- finding and reporting bugs accurately and comprehensively
- coding bugfixes
- coding new features
- writing and correcting documentation

It is important to realize that you do not need any specific skills or knowledge to attend, and to make a valuable contribution. All open-source software is desperate for more help. Part of the purpose of the codesprint is for more experienced developers and documenters to teach beginners how to code and document themselves.

However, if you expect to spend the day being taught how to use software, you’ll be disappointed. Please bear this in mind, and if you think the codesprint is therefore not for you, please give up your ticket – we have very limited places (fewer than a sixth of the places available for the main conference), so many people who do want to contribute will be unable to attend.

We believe that we will work on the following software (dev attending in parentheses):

## QGIS (Martin Dobias)
