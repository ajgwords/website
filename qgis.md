### QGIS 3.36 Maidenhead Released

![](images/qgis-splash336.png)

We are happy to announce that version 3.36 of [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org) (released on 25/02/2024) has been named Maidenhead, after Windsor and Maidenhead Borough Council. Windsor and Maidenhead borough council was one of the first UK local authorities to move to QGIS (at version 1.8!) back in 2010/11. It was at Windsor and Maidenhead that Simon Miles and Matt Travis started the UK QGIS user group. It even hosted the first ever UK user group meeting. Windsor and Maidenhead also contributed financial to many an QGIS plugin and was also a bronze sponsor.

Thanks to everyone on the OSGeo:UK [mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/uk/2024-January/001235.html) who suggested ideas - we had some great [discussions](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/uk/2024-January/001257.html) and learnt something new too!

### QGIS UK User Group

We have a QGIS UK User Group and for a number of years ran successful QGIS User Group meetings in the UK (from 2014 in Stirling, Scotland and at Windsor and Maidenhead in England before that).

More recently there has been significant overlap with FOSS4G:UK meetings, and with the work of OSGeo:UK. With many of the same people being involved in both groups, and with the QGIS User Group not very active apart from FOSS4G:UK, it was decided in [2023](https://uk.osgeo.org/agm/agm2023minutes.html) to host the QGIS UK User Group website here at OSGeo:UK. 

Do check out our [upcoming events](index.html) and regular FOSS4G:UK conferences for your next QGIS conference fix!

#### Group Aims

Our mission in starting the group was to create a community in the UK around QGIS and aim to grow that community through organised meetings, impromptu meet-ups and focused events like hack-days, workshops or code sprints. We want the group to be open, educational, fun and encourage transparency, inclusion and community in the spirit of FOSS. While the focus of the group is on QGIS we hope to build links with other groups including OSGeo, OpenStreetMap and the AGI and encourage users to get involved be it through interest in coding new features, integrating with other applications or producing a good looking map.

#### Donations

Would you like to support the QGIS project by giving a donation? If so there are two ways that you can do this.....

- [Make a donation via the Core QGIS Project](https://donate.qgis.org/)
- Make a donation to UK QGIS

Why make a donation to the UK QGIS chapter? Your donation will be put to work to help support the core QGIS project via polling UK QGIS users what they would like the money spent on. Donations could be put towards:

- Organising or supporting a hackfest here in the UK which might have certain mains that benefit the core development of QGIS.
- Building a plugin that would be specifically beneficial to UK users of QGIS.
- Hiring developers to fix recognised bugs.
- Giving a lump sum of cash to the core QGIS project annually.
- Supporting UK QGIS user group meetings

Who will be looking after UK QGIS donations? The OSGeo:UK local chapter will be handling all the donations given by you to the UK QGIS chapter. This will negate the need for UK QGIS to form a committee with a treasurer. The OSGeo:UK local chapter already have this setup and have kindly lent their support in looking after funds.

- Donate to [OSGeo:UK here](https://uk.osgeo.org/donations.html).
