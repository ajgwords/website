## FOSS4G:UK Local 2022 - Online access

### Thu 17th Nov 2022 09:30 - 16:45 (GMT/UK-London)

If you can't make it to any of the venues, most of the sessions will be available live online, and will also be recorded so you can watch them later. We will be using the [FOSS4G UK YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/FOSS4GUK/streams) for this. You don't need to register - just follow the instructions and links below.

*However* - not all sessions will be streamed, and we can't guarantee that streaming will work all the time from all the venues, so please bear with us, and if a session you want to watch isn't available, try another one!

### How to watch live online

* Check [the event agenda here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ChtOtqO0PfZ2ckiZqqJxyV3VhP3Xm-WnkJ6NwZ2UVTM/)
* Choose the session you want to watch
* At the scheduled time, click the link to watch the session
* When the session finishes, repeat the process for the next session you want to watch - *you will need to do this even if the session is in the same venue*
* If you have questions for the presenter, use the YouTube chat to ask them - the venue leads will try to fit in as many questions as possible
* To chat with other delegates, online or at the venues, use the [OSGeo UK Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#OSGeoUK:matrix.org), or #foss4guk2022 on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/foss4guk).
* Please respond to our survey to give us feedback on the event - the link will be available in the opening and closing session slides

### How to watch the recordings after the event

* Just select a session from the [FOSS4G UK YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/FOSS4GUK/streams) - all the sessions we were able to record will be available permanently

### Contribute to the event

The event is free to attend but we *strongly* encourage attendees (and/or their employers) to make a donation of Â£20 (more if you can afford or less if you can't) - see [here](https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2022local/index.html#registration) for details. All surpluses go towards funding the development of open source geo projects, and events like these are our primary source of funds.
