<p>
Epidemiologists at CHICAS (Centre for Health Informatics, Computing, and Statistics) at Lancaster University have developed code to model disease spread of an important group of Neglected Tropical Diseases. The algorithms are typically written as very long-running "R" scripts.  We present an architecture and prototype implementation of an asynchronous, scalable web-based platform that will be used by public health control professionals in the host countries to analyse disease data and design surveys using model-based geostatistics.
Our eventual aim is to make the design sufficiently flexible so that the software could potentially cope with any type of calculation and input/output combination, including staged calculations. <a href="presentations/Lancaster-Nicholls.pdf"><i>Slides</i></a> <a href="https://youtu.be/WmPrAx-CqC4?t=3429"><i>YouTube</i></a>

<p>
What does life look like at the start of the geospatial data trail? Remote sensing data products start as raw datasets that are inherently not geospatially aware. I will describe the process that SatVu applies to create useful thermal imaging products that can be used by geospatial software. This involves steps such as decoding and calibrating the raw data from the satellite, georeferencing the resulting images to create GeoTIFFs, computing all of the relevant metadata, and making the whole product available to customers via a STAC interface. <a href="presentations/Lancaster-Evans.pdf"><i>Slides</i></a>

<span class="speaker">Barry Rowlingson</span> : <span class="talktitle">Mapping a 1950s Circumnavigation with Open Source and Open Sources.</span>
<p>
Covid lockdown. I started re-reading "Earth My Friend", the tale of Group Captain Peter Townsend's 1956-58 world circumnavigation by Land Rover. This time I read it with QGIS open, and mapped all the locations he mentioned. This involved consulting various online gazetteers, place references, old map collections and historical information. I've now released this data in a geopackage and am working on making it into cartographic products. This talk will show some of the challenges both in driving round the world in the 50s, and mapping data in the 2020s. <a href="presentations/Lancaster-Rowlingson.pdf"><i>Slides</i></a> <a href="https://youtu.be/WmPrAx-CqC4?t=5589"><i>YouTube</i></a>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/Living-with-machines/MapReader">MapReader</a> is a groundbreaking interdisciplinary tool that emerged from a specific set of geospatial historical research questions. It was inspired by methods in biomedical imaging and geographic information science, which were adapted for use by historians. The success of the tool subsequently generated interest from plant phenotype researchers working with large image datasets, and so MapReader is an example of cross-pollination between the humanities and the sciences made possible by reproducible data science. <a href="presentations/Lancaster-McDonough.pdf"><i>Slides</i></a>

<p class="bio">
Katherine McDonough is Lecturer in Digital Humanities in the Department of History at Lancaster University and Senior Research Fellow at The Alan Turing Institute. Her digital work uses computational image, text, and spatial analysis to create new ways of doing historical research with large cultural heritage collections as data. With colleagues from Living with Machines, she co-developed the MapReader software library. She is the UK PI on Machines Reading Maps, a project that creates, curates, and analyses datasets of text on maps for research and discovery applications. In addition to her Turing projects she works on GEODE with colleagues in France.

<span class="speaker">Ana María Pacheco Pascagaza</span> : <span class="talktitle">Connecting Google Colab and Earth Engine for Satellite Imagery Analysis and Vegetation Monitoring</span>
<p>
In a rapid changing Earth and escalating environmental degradation, particularly in terms of vegetation, the need for rapid analysis of satellite imagery is urgent. This presentation unveils the seamless integration of Google Colab with Google Earth Engine, tapping into an extensive repository of remote sensing data. Demonstrating Colab's capabilities, we explore satellite image access, computation of essential vegetation indices, and creation of spatial visualisations. I will present an overview on how generate time series analysis, machine learning, and a practical example of blending diverse data sources to produce various remote-sensing-based maps (e.g., land cover, biomass). <a href="presentations/Lancaster-Pascagaza.pdf"><i>Slides</i></a> <a href="https://youtu.be/HTjURaCkVPM?t=50"><i>YouTube</i></a>

<span class="speaker">Jonny Huck</span> : <span class="talktitle">Paper2GIS: a paper interface to your GIS database</span>
<p>
I will introduce my <a href="https://github.com/jonnyhuck/Paper2GIS">Paper2GIS software</a>, which was created in 2016 for a participatory GIS (PGIS) project on field course to a remote location in the Indian Himalaya. It has subsequently been deployed in both teaching and research settings, both for PGIS and other data collection applications.
</p>
<p>
Paper2GIS allows users to generate maps either using their own basemap design, or automatically using OpenStreetMap. Participants can then draw markup onto the map, which is scanned or photographed and given back to the software. The software uses computer vision techniques to isolate and extract the markup, georeference it, and provide it as either a Shapefile or GeoTiff dataset. Data can be extracted 'as drawn' (polygons representing the pen strokes) - or processed into a range of geometry types including filled polygons (using the outer ring of the markup geometry as a boundary), points (using either geometric centroid or representative point) or convex hulls. <a href="presentations/Lancaster-Huck.pdf"><i>Slides</i></a>
