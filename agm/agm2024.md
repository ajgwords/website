### OSGeo:UK 2024 AGM

**Monday 18th November 2024 at 1pm - 2:30pm (GMT, UK/London)** 

*Online on [Zoom](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/89689342086?pwd=aaOJ7RkXVJN9G5ICmkc1qJU2tF1ebv.1)*

### Agenda

- Apologies for absence
- [Minutes from previous meeting](./agm2023minutes.html){:target="_newpage"}
- Accounts 2023-2024
- Election of officers
- Discussion around election process
    - We noted last year that we needed to encourage other members to put themselves forward for the committee. There are currently no term limits for officers or committee members, so previously it has been very easy to just keep the same people on the committee unless someone actively wants to leave. This year we have more explicitly advertised for people to put themselves forward.
    - Moving forward, we can discuss whether we want to adopt a set term (e.g. 3 years) after which people stand down and the positions are open for election.
