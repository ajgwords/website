Noted that conference insurance question needs to be followed up before the next major conference is organised.

### Accounts 2023-24

 - Total Income: £7,182.58

Noted that some venues in FOSS4G:UK local last year needed some subsidy, hence the small loss. There is expected to be a small surplus in the current year following a successful FOSS4G:UK South West event.
 
### Election of officers

All officers and members apart from Tom Chadwin and Joseph Seddon had indicated their willingness to be re-elected, leaving one vacancy on the committee. After discussion, Catherine Clissold-Jones was unanimously elected to fill the vacant spot, and Jonny Huck proposed as a co-opted member, to be confirmed by the committee. Dave Barter volunteered to work as co-Treasurer with Matt Travis.

The pros and cons of limited terms of 3 years for committee members/officers was discussed. Agreed that this was a long term goal, but was dependent on adequate numbers of members involved to fill positions. Also noted that specific roles for committee members are useful, particularly for new members. Additionally it was pointed out that while we have a constitution because we are required to have one to have a bank account, we can alter it as we wish to to better reflect how we wish to run OSGeo:UK. It was suggested the 'de-formalise' the constitution as much as possible. The committee will discuss all of these points further.

### QGIS Domains - update

Currently https://qgis.uk and https://qgis.org.uk/ redirect to https://uk.osgeo.org/qgis.html as discussed at last years AGM. Jonny mentioned that the domain renewal fees will need to be paid soon. This is all fine and no other action required. 

### Communications - update (inc. newsletter)

Al reported that the newsletter had been a success the peak engagement was 55% from c. 900 subscribed. Circulation is every 2 months.
Tom A agreed to take on a social media comms role to supplement this. Al was congratulated on the quality and success of the newsletter.

The figures for social media followers / communications are:
- UK mailing list: 287 (+6 since 2023)
- Newsletter: ~900 (new in 2024)
- Matrix room: 77 (+1)
- Twitter/X OSGeo:UK: 1,162 (-31)
- Twitter/X FOSS4GUK: 785 (-28)
- Mastodon: 197 (+73)
- Blue Sky: 292 (new in 2024)

### [FOSS4G:UK 2024 South West](https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2024/bristol.html){:target="_newpage"}

Agreed that this was a very successful event, with a full house of c. 65 delegates, and tickets sold out over two weeks before - probably could have sold 100 tickets. Delegates were from all parts of the country, with a great variety of talks.
Noted that diversity was still an issue in audience, talks and committee, although all submitted talks were accepted. Suggested that short talks and online or recorded presentations may help.
Also noted that a budget up front would have been useful.

### Future events

There is some interest in organising FOSS4G Europe or international. Paul has done some initial research, for both Europe and international we would need to express an interest asap. 2026 is first realistic date, though 2027 is also an option. Paul will follow up.
Agreed that we would aim to stage a national event in 2025. Noted that a healthy reserve will be needed to fund this - probably at least £8k. There has been some discussion about holding this in Bristol, but there may be other opportunities - Al will ask for suggestions on the [OSGeo:UK list](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/uk/2024-November/001300.html).
It was suggested that a member of the committee should be responsible for encouraging/coordinating events, large and small. Al volunteered for this. 

### Funding of Open Source Geo Projects ([GoFundGeo](https://uk.osgeo.org/gofundgeo.html))

All proposals agreed:
- pgRouting Gold Sponsorship Level, $1200/£963 per year
- QGIS Sustaining Membership small level, €1,000/£840 per year
- qgis2web: Supporting Andrea Ordonselli to take on and develop gis2web, £1000
- GeoServer, £1,000
- Terra Draw, James Milner, £1,000
- GISRUK & OSGeo:UK GoFundGeo Award, £200
- OSGeo Sponsorship Silver, £0
- Total: £5,003
Budget: ~£6000

For next time, consider diversity goals and improving academic links, and encourage UK-centric bids.

### Any other business

Agreed that the OSGeo:UK website needs a revamp - Al will review. Pages need titles, [Alexi will add an issue for this](https://github.com/osgeouk/website/issues/159).
Links on website for committee should go to OSGeo profiles.

### Date of next AGM - proposing Nov 2025
